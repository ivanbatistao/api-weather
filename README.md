# Api Weather

This project was done as part of my practice of JavaScript + React, HTML & CSS. I used pure React, HTML5, CSS3 (you'll see a bit of flex), Git and VSCode.

This App consumes and [The Weather Api](http://api.openweathermap.org) and allows you to find the current climate of cities, countries, etc. In there you will be able to find a search bar in which you can type the name of a the city, country... and if found it will appear bellow.

Check it out: PokeShow

You can also go and check the [The Components and their respectives CSS files]().

Thanks for taking the time to check this project.

All feedback is welcome!
